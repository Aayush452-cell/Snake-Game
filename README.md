# Snake-Game
Snake Game Built using python

The Game is built with the help of python and Curses libray.

The curses library supplies a terminal-independent screen-painting and keyboard-handling facility for text-based terminals; such terminals include VT100s, the Linux console, and the simulated terminal provided by various programs. Display terminals support various control codes to perform common operations such as moving the cursor, scrolling the screen, and erasing areas. Different terminals use widely differing codes, and often have their own minor quirks.

We can download curses for window by running command : ''' pip install windows-curses '''
